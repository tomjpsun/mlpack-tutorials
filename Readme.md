This repo includes the scripts/data demonstrated in `mlpack` tutorials.
Which can be found in https://www.mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.4.1/doxygen/nstutorial.html
(3.4.1 is the currently the newest mlpack version)

The object is to exploring the functions in `mlpack`,
I think by observing tutorials can be of great help.
