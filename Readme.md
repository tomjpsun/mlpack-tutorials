This repo includes the scripts/data demonstrated in `mlpack` tutorials.
Which can be found in https://www.mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.4.1/cli_documentation.html#method-specific-tutorials
(3.4.1 is the currently the newest mlpack version)

The object is to exploring the functions in `mlpack`, so user has to prepare mlpack:

	sudo apt install libmlpack-dev mlpack-bin

I think by observing tutorials can be of great help.
